In this project i have work on Notes Making App  
User can add notes and also delete the notes when it not required by the user.  
I have made a text area in which user can write a notes in the text area and after clicking on the "Add Notes" button notes will appear in the "Your Notes" section. 
                    
I have used the concept of the local storage for getting the notes and deletion of notes.
